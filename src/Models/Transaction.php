/**
 * Transaction information.
 * 
 * @property int $id the primary key
 * @property string $pid the universally unique  id that can be shared with the public
 * @property string|int ${tenant-id}  the id of the owner tenant
 * @property int $parent_id the transaction the this transaction is related to, i.e for self join
 * @property string $cashier_id the id of an admin user/if any, who processed the transaction.
 * @property string $orderable_id relationship with orderable. 
 * @property int $orderable_amount the max amount that need to be captured for this transaction
 * @property string $currency
 * @property int  $amount_escrow the total amount confirmed available that can be received from this transaction. The amount may be held by the provider or a third-party. It can be requested for on a later date.
 * @property int  $amount_escrow_claimed the total amount claimed from escrow. NOTE: This should only be used to only locally determine the remaining amount to be claimed; it should not be used for any other calculations.
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon  $escrow_claimed_at the date of last escrow claim
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon  $escrow_expires_at the expiry date of escrow
 * @property int $amount total amount received from this transaction. Must be 0 for a refund-only transaction(i.e column 'refund'=true). Must always be positive.
 * @property int $amount_refunded total refunded for this transaction. Must always be negative.
 * @property string $transaction_family the transaction family/object name. E.g Stripe's 'payment_intent','refund', 'charge' etc 
 * @property string transaction_family_id this should uniquely identify the family/group within this transaction. E.g the corresponding Stripe's payment_intent_id
 * @property string $transaction_child_id this represents a unique item belonging to transaction family with id of
 * transaction_family_id.  
 * E.g a charge_id on the corresponding Stripe's payment_intent_id=transaction_family_id. Typically 
 * for Stripe a payment intent will have an array of charge objects where only one is successful. So the 
 * id of the corresponding charge object goes here.        
 * @property bool $success determines if transaction has succeeded
 * @property bool $refund  the transaction is a refund-only transaction when this is TRUE.
 * @property bool $display_only when TRUE the transaction is a dummy and should not be involved in calculations      
 * @property string $status transaction overall status as defined by the payment provider;
 * @property string $local_status transaction overall status defined by the app/package
 * @property bool $retrospective determines whether this is created either through webhook or going to the provider to confirm that payment was successful 
 * @property bool $through_webhook is this created through a webhook
 * @property bool $address_matched when TRUE the payment provider fraud checker system has matched the postcode  of the address used to process the transaction.
 * @property bool $postcode_matched when TRUE the payment provider fraud checker system has matched the postcode  of the payment method used to process the transaction.
 * @property bool $cvc_matched when TRUE the payment provider fraud checker system has matched the postcode  of the CVC used to process the transaction.
 * @property bool $threed_secure determines if the transaction was thread secure according to the payment provider
 * @property string $description transaction description
 * @property string $notes additional notes
 * @property array $meta  arbitrary transaction data
 * @property bool $livemode determines whether the transaction is a live transaction
 * @property string $user_type the class/type of the customer (aka logged user)  who own this transaction
 * @property string $user_id the identifier of the customer customer (aka logged user) who own this transaction
 * @property string $card_type type of card used to process the transaction
 * @property string $last_four the last 4 number of the card used to process the transaction
 * @property string $payment_provider the payment provider who processed the transaction
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon created_at the date transaction was created
 * @property \Carbon\Carbon updated_at The date of last update
